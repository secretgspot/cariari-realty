### TODO

- [ ] Map Filter
- [ ] Store across pages (sapper/store?)
- [ ] LocalStorage for some of the settings
- [x] Filters settings should be in store (works yet incomplete, why?)
- [x] Map snapshot for property details (gps)
- [x] Map snapshot for Editor if GPS is set
- [x] RESOLVE ISSUE WITH StaticMap.svelte apiKey loading before everything else and causing 401 in imgSrc
- [ ] Validation of add/edit property, (~~msl~~, ~~for~~, gps, phone, email, )
- [ ] Env var for company name, phone, email for use across site ** plan for deploying to different areas
- [ ] Perhaps an indicator that property is sold or rented.
- [ ] Implementation of poly.google.com/ or pannellum.org or matterport.com or sketchfab VR walkthru with or without images
- [ ] Concider using geojson to have more control over layers and markers
- [ ] MapboxGL has issues on firefox and any other browsers that don't support webgl. HereMap?!
- [x] Details, fix image fiting. âœ” button to close needs positioning
