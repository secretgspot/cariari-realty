      "description" : "This magnificent home is comprised of three parts. The first one is the main house that was constructed some eight years ago. It has nearly 4,200 square feet of space that includes a living room, a dining room, kitchen with a side tea room, office, guest bathroom, a laundry area and parking for three cars on the lower floor. On the second floor you will find the master bedroom and two adjacent rooms each with its own bathroom.\n\nIt must be added that it is fully furnished with the finest furniture and art pieces that you could wish for. The second part is a guest house built some four years ago and it has some 1400 square feet with two large bedrooms, each with its own washroom, a living room and an open kitchen. Again, built and decorated with only the finest materials and furnishings. The third part is a recreational gazebo of some 1,100 square feet overlooking the pool with its own swim-to round bar and cascading water.\n\nThis is truly like having your own five-star tropical paradise hotel at your pleasure. The best is that you don't have to go far away to enjoy it!",

All existing 34 smoke-free hotel rooms are quite modern and spacious and are fully loaded, each with two large beds, clean, cool ceramic-tiled floors, private baths (some with bidets), all with large color TV's, & wireless internet runs throughout the hotel.  All rooms have A/C, direct dial phones with free international and local calls, coffee makers, a small writing table and chairs, a closet and dresser, and an in-room safe. There are three suites which have in-bath Jacuzzis, microwaves and a small fridge.  There is a sixty person bar and restaurant, and a big two story solarium room with a large Mayan waterfall aquarium, a solar-heated Jacuzzi beside the new pool, a computer station with four computers for people without a laptop, and a new fully equipped gym.  The location is multi-purpose. It is ideal for first and last night stays in Costa Rica for tourists and condo owners, as well as being conveniently located directly across the street from the New Convention Center.",
